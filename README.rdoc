== What the hell should this app do?
* Creates Public feeds of image posts content that can be sortable by #hashtags.
* Allows users to have private feeds for a certain group of friends
* Allows users to upvote and downvote images
* Allows users to leave comments on each image

== Current Overview of the Tech Stack

* Ruby 2.0
* Rails 4 beta
* Backbone
-- Testing
* Factory Girl
* Cucumber (I don't think I configured the selenium/webkit for this yet )
* Rspec
-- Database
* Right now its sqlite3 I'm assuming we'll have to change it at some point if we want to do a real time app
-- Not decided
* Sass
* Haml
* Bootstrap 

== Things to think about
* What is MVP? 
  * My thought process was to just start simple.  Public feed where anyone can comment, upvote, downvote, etc
  * Essentially all the functionality before worrying about users.
* Wondering if it would be worth it to let people follow other users? 
* Also wondering if it should also incldue sharing any link not just images
  * In other words a random place for people to share articles or images with a select group of friends?
* Seriously I haven't really thought out this app... feel free to change anything from the tech stack to the actual project, whatever...this project is mainly so that I can play with rails 4 and backbone so if you're interested in trying out something just throw it in
